- term: API
  definition: "The term _Application Programming Interface_ is quite a confused term in the context of FHIR. Strictly speaking, an API is a set of services offered by a programming library that can be made use of by another application. Historically these would have been made available from a single machine although now they are available across networks.<br /><br />In the service/message/document categorisation, an API is a service interface, though this categorisation is contentious. As technology became increasingly capable of supporting distributed operations, the differences between SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) and APIs became blurred. In the context of FHIR, we define APIs as RESTful interfaces."
