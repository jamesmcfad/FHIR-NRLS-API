The Deploy section contains descriptions of approaches and suggestions for building APIs at the Assure stage.

As part of the testing phase, how an API is deployed needs to be determined to understand how it will interact with other aspect of the environment that it is to be deployed within. Access mechanism and security considerations should be taken into account, that include but are not limited to:

-	Traffic Management
-	Endpoints
-	Authentication and authorization
-	Encryption

These are all important design decisions that need to be reviewed.
