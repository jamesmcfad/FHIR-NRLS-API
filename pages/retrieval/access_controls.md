summary: Overview of NRL access controls.
---

The NRL and SSP are subject to various technical access controls and restrictions, as outlined on the [security](security_guidance.html) page. These controls protect information flowing between the client and server. However, this transport-layer security does not address authentication and authorisation of the users consuming the shared information.

Consumers are required to ensure an appropriate level of authentication and authorisation is applied, within their systems, when giving users access to information received via Spine services.

# Healthcare Professional Access

Where the consuming system is making a request on behalf of a healthcare professional, the system **MUST** have authenticated the user using:

- NHS Identity
- National Smartcard Authentication
- Equivalent level-3 Authentication

The user details, including user ID and associated [Role Based Access Controls](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/spine-core/security_rbac.html) (RBAC) role, **MUST** be included in the JWT as specified on the [JSON Web Token Guidance](jwt_guidance.html) page.

Consumers **MUST** apply appropriate RBAC governance to manage access to different types of pointers and retrieved information.

# Citizen Access

Where the consuming system is making a request for information on behalf of a citizen, the system **MUST** have authenticated the citizen to the [DCB3051 Identity Verification and Authentication Standard for Digital Health and Care Services](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/dcb3051-identity-verification-and-authentication-standard-for-digital-health-and-care-services).

The user details **MUST** be included in the JWT as specified on the [JSON Web Token Guidance](jwt_guidance.html) page.

## NHS Login

[NHS login](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/nhs-login/) verifies citizens' identities and authenticates them to the required standard to use the NRL and SSP services.

## Types of Citizen Access

There are a number of different scenarios in which citizens may require access to information. For each of these scenarios there are a number of information governance requirements that must be met, as outlined in the sections below.

### Citizens accessing their own data

The following requirements **MUST** be met when giving a citizen access to their own data:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th style="width:35%">Requirement</th>
