### Solution Assurance Process Overview ###

1.	The Programme Team will provide Suppliers with the necessary information and materials to enable them to determine the feasibility of developing a technical product. This can be done with a combination of face to face and WebEx. The NRL on-boarding guide will be provided that details the full end-to-end process for integrating with the NRL. A copy can be obtained from the NRL Service page at [https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-record-locator-nrl](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-record-locator-nrl).

2.	Supplier completes a Usage and Settings document to get Programme approval for usage and settings of the NRL. 
	
	*Note*: The Usage and Settings document is not needed for the pilot.
 
3. The <a href="mailto:itkconformance@nhs.net">Solution Assurance team</a> will work with the supplier through development and assurance to provide assistance with technical support and test and assurance queries and conduct the review of Supplier submissions.

4. As part of this process the supplier will need to complete a SCAL (Supplier Conformance and Assessment List). The SCAL should be completed by adding comments and/or pointing to evidence. 

5.	A baseline version of the SCAL can be downloaded from the onboarding guide. A copy of which can be obtained from the NRL Service page at [https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-record-locator-nrl](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-record-locator-nrl).
The SCAL will be filtered for each supplier by the Solution Assurance team to reflect only the requirements and related tests that are in scope for the supplier product.

6. Supplier should carry out initial development against TKW testbench. The testbench and a quick start guide is available at [https://developer.nhs.uk/testcentre/itk-nrls/](https://developer.nhs.uk/testcentre/itk-nrls/)

7.	Further testing can be done in test environments OpenTest or DEV. The environments will be populated with test data which will support all test cases identified by the SCAL.  Suppliers will be able to carry out their own initial testing in these environments.

8.	Further data can be added to test environments by suppliers using a self-service portal.

9.	Solution Assurance will provide access to the test environments.

10.	Whilst connected to the INT test environment, the Supplier will be expected to execute the System Test cases provided by NHS Digital as identified within the SCAL. The linked evidence of screenshots and message logs from these tests will be captured and provided to NHS Digital for validation. The Functional Integration Tests against a PTL environment (specifically INT) provides risk mitigation against the live service deployment.

11.	Some negative Functional Tests which form part of the assurance will be performed against TKW testbench. 

12.	On successful completion of testing, Solution Assurance will provide a Conformance Certificate, and the SCAL is updated to reflect this status.

13.	In parallel the non-test related SCAL tabs will be completed by the supplier.

14.	Any open defects relating to the test are shared with NHS Digital stakeholders for 
agreement regarding a work off plan. Work off plan items may need to be resolved prior to Go Live/Post Pilot.

15.	The supplier is now ready for a live deployment, which will be managed by the NHS Digital Operations and Service Management team. This will involve the end user organisation completing the EUD (End User Declaration) via the EUOP (End User Online Portal) which provided sign-off to NHS Digital. 
Note: there may be some additional Clinical Safety group involvement at this stage, should the SCAL assessment flag their sign-off as being required. The same applies to the IG assessment, which may also flag NHS Digital sign-off required.
