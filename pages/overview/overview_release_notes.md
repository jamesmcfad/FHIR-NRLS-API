## 1.1.0-beta ##

*Changes to re-align the NRLS API 1.1.0-beta Specification with the DDC March and May 2018 NRLS Service Development Iterations:*

- Provider and Consumer API Read interaction removed.
- Provider and Consumer API Search interaction changes:
  - `_count` Search parameter removed
  - `_id` Search parameter added
  - `type` Search parameter added
  - `patient` search parameter reverted to `subject`
  - Bundle type `searchset` does not support:
    - Encoded client search parameters in returned bundle using the `self link`.
    - The identity of resources in the entry using the `fullUrl` element.
    - Resources matched in a successful search using the `search.mode` element
 - Provider API Update interaction removed.
 - Provider API Delete interaction changes:
   - Now supports conditional delete interaction. Allows a provider to delete an existing pointer based on the search parameter `_id` which refers to the logical id of the pointer.
 - Spine response codes changes:
   - Amended for all Provider and Consumer API interactions
   - Successful Provider Create and Delete interactions now support positive response code values conveyed in the response body [Spine-OperationOutcome-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/Spine-OperationOutcome-1) payload:
     - RESOURCE_CREATED
     - RESOURCE_ DELETED
   - Error Handling section updated to reflect API re-alignment with DDC NRLS Service implementation.
   - Exceptions raised by the Spine Core common requesthandler and not the NRLS Service will be supported by the default Spine OperationOutcome [spine-operationoutcome-1-0](https://fhir.nhs.uk/StructureDefinition/spine-operationoutcome-1-0) profile which binds to the default Spine valueSet [spine-response-code-1-0](https://fhir.nhs.uk/ValueSet/spine-response-code-1-0). Codes include:
     - UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE
- Pagination removed from Provider and Consumer search API.
- CapabilityStatement conformance functionality removed from this release.
- For this release the NRLS Service returns data as the default format of `XML`. 
- [NRLS-DocumentReference-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/NRLS-DocumentReference-1) FHIR profile upversioned to 1.1.0. Changes as follows:
  - [ValueSet-NRLS-RecordType-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/ValueSet/NRLS-RecordType-1) replaces ValueSet/CarePlanType-1
  - ValueSet-NRLS-RecordType-1 supports a single SNOMED concept:  `736253002 - Mental health crisis plan (record artifact)`.
  - All NRLS-DocumentReference-1 API examples updated to support record type: `Mental health crisis plan (record artifact)`. 
- [Solution Interactions](overview_interactions.html) diagrams updated.
- NRLS access token (JWT) enhancements:
  - The NRLS access token conforms to the Spine [JWT](https://nhsconnect.github.io/FHIR-SpineCore/security_jwt.html) definition.
  - New section [Access Tokens and Audit (JWT)](integration_access_tokens_and_audit_JWT.html) added which replaces the Cross Organisation Audit & Provenance section.
 - [Assurance Process](assure.html) overview added to specification.



*Sprint 6 Summary:*

- Concept of direct and indirect pointers removed from API. Changes to the [Data Model](overview_data_model.html#data-model) and the [NRLS-DocumentReference-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/NRLS-DocumentReference-1) FHIR profile as follows: 
  - RecordRetrievalMode CodeableConcept functionality removed from the [NRLS-DocumentReference-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/NRLS-DocumentReference-1) FHIR profile. 
  - The following dependent FHIR assets have been removed from NHS FHIR Server and implementation guide:
    - Extension-NRLS-RecordRetrievalMode-1
    - ValueSet-NRLS-RecordRetrievalMode-1
    - CodeSystem-NRLS-RecordRetrievalMode-1

<!--`custodian` search parameter dropped from Consumer API. In turn the combined `patient and custodian` search parameter has also been dropped from Consumer API. See the [Error Handling section](development_general_api_guidance.html#consumer-search-should-return-422-with-error-code-of-invalid_parameter-under-the-following-circumstances) for further guidance.
- Additional Consumer and Provider API guidance added to [Parameters - INVALID_PARAMETER](development_general_api_guidance.html#parameters---invalid_parameter) Error Handling section.-->
- Consumer Provider API XML/ JSON examples added
- HTTP request headers amendments: 
  - Ssp-TraceID, Ssp-InteractionID, Ssp-Version - dropped from specification
  - Ssp-From and Ssp-To - Header name change to `fromASID` and `toASID`
