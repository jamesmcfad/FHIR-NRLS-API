# Introduction

The National Record Locator (NRL) has been developed primerally to allow healthcare professionals, in any health or care setting, to locate and access patient information shared by other healthcare organisations to support the direct care of patients. NRL also empowers professionals, patients and communities, strengthens primary, secondary, and acute care and allows introduction of system efficiencies.


NHS England's Target Architecture states that platforms moving forward will be expected to use common national services, standards, and governance processes to ensure national cohesion, including the NRL. More information can be found at [the NHS England page on Interoperability](https://www.england.nhs.uk/digitaltechnology/info-revolution/interoperability/).
